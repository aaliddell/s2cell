    # orientation).

    # following. In that case, we will be offset left and down by one leaf cell in each of I and J,

    # in 0), since there are no trailing ..00..  available after the ``..10..`` when we are at level
    # 29+.

    Get neighbor S2 cell ID for a given S2 cell ID.

    There are two types of neighbors: edge neighbors and corner neighbors, which
    share either an edge or corner with the input cell respectively. Normally,
    there are 4 corner neighbors and 4 edge neighbors for each cell. However, at
    cube face corners, there are only 3 corner neighbors as there is not cell
    beyond the corner vertex that isn't already represented by an edge neighbor.

    By default, only edge neighbors are returned from this function, unless
    corner is True.

    The order of the returned cell IDs is guaranteed to be in the order down,
    right, up, left from the input cell ID, If corner neighbors are requested,
    they will be interleaved correctly in that order. Note that face orientation
    may mean these directions are not where you expect on a globe.
